    "# Software Installation (Mac on Apple Metal M1)\n",
    "This class is technically oriented.  A successful student needs to be able to compile and execute Python code that makes use of TensorFlow for deep learning. There are two options for you to accomplish this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Install Python, TensorFlow, and some IDE (Jupyter, TensorFlow, and others)\n",
    "* Use Google CoLab in the cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Python and TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "Is your Mac Intel or Apple Metal (ARM)? The newer Mac ARM M1-based machines have considerably better deep learning support than their older Intel-based counterparts. Mac has not supported NVIDIA GPUs since 2016; however, the new M1 chips offer similar capabilities that will allow you to run most of the code in this course.  You can run any code not supported by the Apple M1 chip through Google CoLab, a free GPU-based Python environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are running an older Intel Mac, there still are some options.  Refer to my [Intel Mac installation guide](tensorflow-install-mac-jan-2021.ipynb). \n",
    "\n",
    "With the introduction of the M1 chip, Apple introduced a system on a chip.  The new Mac M1 contains CPU, GPU, and deep learning hardware support, all on a single chip. The Mac M1 can run software created for the older Intel Mac's using an emulation layer called [Rosetta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_(software)). To leverage the new M1 chip from Python, you must use a special Python distribution called [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge). Miniforge replaces other Python distributions that you might have installed, such as Anaconda or Miniconda. Apple instructions suggest that you remove Anaconda or Miniconda before installing Miniforge.  Because the Mac M1 is a very different architecture than Intel, the Miniforge distribution will maximize your performance. Be aware that once you install Miniforge, it will become your default Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install Miniforge\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a variety of methods for installing Miniforge.  If you have trouble following my instructions, you may refer to this [installation process](https://developer.apple.com/metal/tensorflow-plugin/), upon which I base these instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "I prefer to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install Miniforge.  Homebrew is a package manager for the Mac, similar to **yum** or **apt-get** for Linux. To install Homebrew, follow this [link](https://brew.sh/) and copy/paste the installation command into a Mac terminal window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have installed Homebrew, I suggest closing the terminal window and opening a new one to complete the installation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you should install the xcode-select command-line utilities.  Use the following command to install:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "xcode-select --install\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the above command gives an error, you should install XCode from the App Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will now use Homebrew to install Miniforge with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "brew install miniforge\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should note which directory \n",
    "\n",
    "## Initiate Miniforge\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the following command to initiate your conda base environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda init\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will set the python `PATH` to the Miniforge base in your profile (`~/.bash_profile` if bash or `~/.zshenv` if zsh) and create the base virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Mac's orgionally used bsh and have now switched to zsh.  You can also run the above command as ```conda init zsh``` to specify zshell or ```conda init bash``` for bash.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Make Sure you Have the Correct Python (when things go wrong)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes previous versions of Python might have been installed, and when you attempt to run the install script below you will recieve an error:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Collecting package metadata (repodata.json): done\n",
    "Solving environment: failed\n",
    "\n",
    "ResolvePackageNotFound: \n",
    "  - tensorflow-deps\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To verify that you have the correct Python version registered, close and reopen your terminal window.  Issue the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "which python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command should respond with something similar to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniforge/base/bin/python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The key things to look for in the above response are \"homebrew\" and \"miniforge\".  If you see \"anaconda\" or \"miniconda\" your path is pointing to the wrong Python.  You will need to modify your \".zshrc\", make sure that the three Python paths match the path that \"brew\" installed it into earlier.  Most likely your \"miniforge\" is installed in one of these locations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* /usr/local/Caskroom/miniforge/base\n",
    "* /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniforge/base\n",
